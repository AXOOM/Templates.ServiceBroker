# My Service Broker

my description

## Development

Run `build.ps1` to compile the source code and package the result in Docker images. This script takes a version number as an input argument. The source code itself contains no version numbers. Instead version numbers should be determined at build time using [GitVersion](http://gitversion.readthedocs.io/).

Configuration overrides for local development are specified in:
- [launchSettings.json](src/ServiceBroker/Properties/launchSettings.json) for IDEs
- [docker-compose.override.yml](src/docker-compose.override.yml) for Docker Compose

To build and then run locally with Docker Compose:
```powershell
./build.ps1
cd src
docker-compose up --build
```
You can then interact with the API at: http://localhost:12345/swagger/

The credentials for local test instances are username `test` and password `test`.

To allow Prometheus metrics to be exposed when running locally run:
```powershell
netsh http add urlacl http://*:5000/ user=$env:USERDOMAIN\$env:USERNAME
```
You can then access the metrics at: http://localhost:5000/

## Deployment

My Service Broker is deployed using [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile).

The deployment is configured using environment variables (see [.gitlab-ci.yml](.gitlab-ci.yml) and [helmfile.yaml](helmfile.yaml)):

| Name                      | Default          | Description                                                                                |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GitVersion_NuGetVersion` | *required*       | The version number generated by GitVersion. Used to find the Docker image.                 |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`  | `Production`     | Selects environment-specific settings. Set to `Development` to enable debug logging, etc.. |
| `USERNAME`                | `user`           | The username for access to the broker.                                                     |
| `PASSWORD`                | *auto-generated* | The password for access to the broker.                                                     |
| `PUBLIC_DOMAIN`           |                  | A public domain to expose the broker under. Leave empty for cluster-only access.           |

Once the Broker is deployed in the cluster you should be able to see the services it provides by running:
```
kubectl get clusterserviceclass
```
